Autonomous Driving
==================

.. NOTE:: This instruction was tested on ``Ubuntu 16.04`` and ``ROS Kinetic Kame``.

We are currently doing several projects related with the keywords: Autonomous Driving and TurtleBot3s

TurtleBot3 Auto
------------------

In the video, TurtleBot3 gets its eye by attaching a $40 Raspberry Pi Camera and adopts open source from MIT DuckieTown engineering to track the lane.

and soon (In January, 2018), official autonomous driving package for turtlebot3 will be released.

AutoRace is a competition for autonomous driving robot platforms. To provide various conditions for robot application development, the game gives as less structural regulation as possible. Entire contents are opened in software (source codes for referee system) wise and hardware (stp / dwg files of game map) wise.
Whole robots and even the referee system in the field is run by ROS, so it would support to make many kinds of contents further.

Get opened source of what is participated in each competitions!
